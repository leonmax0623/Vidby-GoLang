The goal: Different voice colours with a variety of emotional expressions are offered to match the protagonists of the videos. The voices can be clearly assigned to an age category and a biological sex. 123\n\nIn the future, vidby's speech interfaces will even be able to convey emotions such as joy, anger, amazement or sadness. vidby's sophisticated translation technology will ultimately even recognize emotions and intonations. It defines sentence boundaries for real-time translation.\n\nSpeech and music can also be subsequently removed from an audio file. Spelling and punctuation is automatic.	en
