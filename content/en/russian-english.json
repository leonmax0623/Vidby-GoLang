And the first problem that appears immediately is the difficulties while translating and dubbing the videos in different languages. In this short article, we will talk about the language pair of Russian and English, how to translate a video from Russian to English, and the benefits of working with a video translator VidBy.</p>\n<h2><strong>The popularity and specification of the language pair</strong></h2>\n<p>Russian and English is a fascinating and famous languages pair just because many people worldwide can fluently speak and understand them. So, it is crucially important to have a shot at translating and dubbing your videos within the frame of this language pair.</p>\n<p>English is the world&rsquo;s first most spoken language that is spoken by over one billion people. This language has many dialects, like American English, British English, Australian English, etc.</p>\n<p>Russian is the language that is commonly used by the citizens of Russia. However, many people from the CIS countries can understand it as well.</p>\n<p>The complexity of this language pair lies in Russian because it is one of the most difficult languages to learn. Consequently, there are not so many specialists who can translate and dub your videos in the right way. But VidBy can help you solve this problem and translate Russian video to English with a great accurate rate.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to translate from Russian to English: The algorithm of work</strong></h2>\n<p>VidBy applies an innovative technology based on the implementation of artificial intelligence, so the question appears how to translate Russian video to English with the help of this platform. Right now, we are going to explain the algorithm of its work from your perspective.</p>\n<p>So, it is necessary to upload your video to the service so the service understands what it needs to translate. As an additional option, you can put a direct link to the video you want to localize in a special line in the middle of the website&rsquo;s home page.</p>\n<p>Afterward, you will be asked to specify the details of your order so that the service will be able to choose the right algorithm for translation and dub the video from Russian to English or vice versa. The needed information is the video&rsquo;s original language, the language of the translated fragment, the voice&rsquo;s details, etc.</p>\n<p>One more thing to require is the payment for the services. Without paying, the service will not start the process. You can choose one of the following payment systems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visa/Mastercard;</li>\n<li>ApplePay/GooglePay;</li>\n<li>PayPal;</li>\n<li>SWIFT transfers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the payment is made successfully, the software will initiate the process and inform you when it will be ended. After this, you will receive a link to download the final result.</p>\n<h2><strong>Additional features of VidBy</strong></h2>\n<p>You see that the online Russian to English video translation process is not that complicated from your perspective. Still, the platform developers have tried their best and developed additional features to make the video translator service advanced and better.</p>\n<h3><strong>Add a drop of emotions</strong></h3>\n<p>Without emotions, any translated and dubbed video is nothing, and it cannot share the primary idea to the audience properly. That is why it was decided to develop a feature that would add some emotional touch. At the present moment, this idea is in the stage of development. However, users can already take advantage of it and apply a few emotions to the videos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anger;</li>\n<li>Joy;</li>\n<li>Sadness;</li>\n<li>Surprise;</li>\n<li>Fear;</li>\n<li>Disgust.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And with their help, your dubbed videos will be way more realistic and will be able to convey the idea in the right way.</p>\n<h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3>\n<p>One more thing to consider is the availability to generate a translated speech by using different voices, like the voices of children, teenagers, adults, and seniors. So, it is another step to making VidBy the perfect service specializing in video and audio translation processes.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong></h2>\n<p>You know about two additional features that help VidBy stand out from the crowd.
