And there is no need to explain why English is so popular.</p>\n<p>However, not many people are qualified to translate from French into English and in the opposite direction (English-French). What is more, French is not an easy-to-learn language, and many dialects have their specifications. Thus, the need to translate the video in the frame of this language group is in high demand.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to translate from French to English: The algorithm of work</strong></h2>\n<p>If you want to know how this innovative video translation service from French to English works, we will explain it briefly while indicating the important steps.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, it is necessary to visit the service's official website. And then, you need to go through a few simple steps to make the video and audio translation done.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step 1. It is necessary to provide the online video translator service with a video you want to translate French video to English or vice versa. So, you can either upload this video from your device or put a link to the video in a special line.</li>\n<li>Step 2. Without the specification of your order, it will not be possible to reach an appropriate result. This, you will be asked to indicate the original language of the video, the language you want to translate your video(s) into, voices that will be assigned, etc. In addition to this, you can also choose the format of the video output.</li>\n<li>Step 3. The algorithm will calculate the total price of the video translation service and show you the estimated delivery time. However, it will not start processing the translation if the payment is not made. Thus, it is mandatory to pay for this service.</li>\n<li>Step 4. This is the easiest step because it does not require anything but your patient. After completing your payment, you will need to wait before the software will translate a video from French to English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, you know how VidBy translates and dubs videos from French into English and on the other side.</p>\n<h2><strong>Additional features of VidBy</strong></h2>\n<p>VidBy makes everything sure to become the best of the best. With the help of additional features, the video translation service stands out from other video translation services that can translate a video from French to English.</p>\n<h3><strong>Add a drop of emotions</strong></h3>\n<p>The first feature that is worth considering is the company's latest development. It allows customers to receive more realistic translated and dubbed videos. Presently, this feature is in the stage of development, but it still has a few emotions that everyone can apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anger;</li>\n<li>Sadness;</li>\n<li>Joy;</li>\n<li>Surprise;</li>\n<li>Disgust;</li>\n<li>Fear.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The video translation service VidBy is still working on extending this list and plans to do it as soon as possible. This development is designed to help the translated and dubbed videos sound more natural.</p>\n<h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3>\n<p>One more innovative solution that adds to all translated videos a natural tone is the speech synthesizer. To put it into a simple sentence, this complicated concept refers to the generation of video translation in different voices. Among the available voices are the voices of children, teenagers, adults, and seniors. So, it is getting easier to share your message with the world correctly.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the benefits of working with us?</strong></h2>\n<p>VidBy understands the importance of making the video translation properly. And with this idea in mind, the development team has put a lot of effort into this direction so that the outcome will be satisfactory.</p>\n<h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3>\n<p>First of all, it is worth considering the quick delivery time of translated videos from French into English for any difficulties. If many video translation services can do the translation and dubbing of the videos within the frame of a few hours or days, VidBy can do the same thing faster. To translate French video to English (a one-minute video fragment), it is necessary to wait two minutes. And this fast delivery time is because of the implementation of the AI-powered algorithm, which saves a lot of time, and there is no need to hire professional artists and translators.</p>\n<h3><strong>Guaranteed quality of the services</strong></h3>\n<p>The second crucial moment that makes a difference is the quality of the translated videos from French into English. The AI-based technology allows the software to do a great job, and the done job (translation and dubbing) is fascinating. It is almost impossible to distinguish the translation/dubbing made by this software and real people. So, you should not have doubts while considering this aspect.</p>\n<h3><strong>Low cost</strong></h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, the video translation service VidBy is based on AI-powered software that guarantees a great outcome. However, it is always interesting to know the price of such a service. In general, the cost of this service is affordable because the software cuts off the expenses that involve real people (professionals). And if you want to reduce the costs to the maximum, you should consider the next benefit of using VidBy.</p>\n<h3><strong>A variety of subscriptions</strong></h3>\n<p>For sure, everyone can use the video translation service VidBy for a one-time purpose. Still, people who have a need to translate video English to French regularly can take advantage of three different subscriptions that allow the customers to reduce their costs. The subscriptions (Basis, Extended, and Professional) were specifically designed for clients with additional needs. For instance, clients who need to dub their videos from French into English with one voice should consider the basic plan. At the same time, more demanding people can greatly benefit from the Extended and Professional subscriptions.</p>\n<h3><strong>An opportunity to edit</strong></h3>\n<p>As we have touched on the Professional subscription, you need to know that under the frames of this plan, the customers are capable of using one unique feature of editing transcripts. Even though the translation and dubbing are wonderful and almost absolutely accurate, there is sometimes a need to put some changes into the transcripts. Bear in mind that this outstanding feature is only available for the subscribers of the Professional subscription.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to get a translated video from French to English?</strong></h2>\n<p>There is nothing complicated about how to translate a video from French to English. The first thing that you need to do is to visit the official website of VidBy. On the main page, you will see an empty line with the button Start, which is located under this line. The video translation service will ask you to put a link to the video you want to translate and dub or upload the video to the service. When you have done this, the Start button will be available to click on, and you can go forward to the second step - to specify your order.</p>\n<p>During this step, you need to provide the service with specific information about your order. This information usually includes the original language of the video, the language in which you want to translate it (whether it is French or English), the selection of voices, which will be assigned to the video, and the format of the outcome video.</p>\n<p>While adding all these details, the service will automatically calculate and estimate the delivery time and the costs of the video translation. You should firstly pay for the service before the algorithm starts video translation.</p>\n<p>When the payment is successful, the technology will translate video English to French. The only thing that remains is to wait until you are able to download the translated and dubbed video.</p>\n<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> How to translate French videos into English?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are looking for ways to translate and dub your French video into English, it is worth considering the video translation innovative service VidBy.
