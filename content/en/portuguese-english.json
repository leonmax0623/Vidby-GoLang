Businesses, governmental institutions, universities, and film industry companies want to translate and dub their videos from Portuguese to English or in the opposite direction. So, what is the most effective approach to do so?</p> <p>In this article, we will answer the most worrying question - how to translate a video from Portuguese to English? In addition, you will learn that this process is a piece of cake (if you use the services of VidBy). So, let us start with the consideration of the language pair first and its specifications.</p> <h2> <strong>The popularity and complexities of the language pair (Portuguese-English)</strong> </h2> <p>It is a well-known truth that English is the most popular language in the world. Approximately 400 million are native speakers of this language, while over one billion people can understand it fluently. Even though this language has over 160 distinct dialects, it is not a massive problem for communication.</p> <p>On the other side, we have Portuguese. This language belongs to the worldâ€™s top ten most spoken languages because over 154 million native speakers and over 100 million people speak it as their second language. Portuguese heritages many words from Latin, so it is not that difficult to do an accurate translation. However, the best way to find an answer to the question (how to translate a video from Portuguese into English?) is the video translation service VidBy.</p> <h2><strong>The algorithm of work: How to translate a video from Portuguese into English at VidBy?</strong></h2> <p>There is nothing complicated in understanding the algorithm of work of the video translation service VidBy. But, it is necessary to know that the video translation approach is in roots different from the traditional ways of the video translation. While many video translation services rely on real people (they hire professional voice translators and other experts), VidBy takes charge of its innovative solution, which is basically based on artificial intelligence.</p> <p>So, firstly, it is necessary to upload the video, which will be translated and dubbed from Portuguese to English or vice versa, or put a direct link to the video and click on the Start button.</p> <p>After doing this, the video translation service VidBy will request you to specify the details of your order. Usually, it is a few questions to make the translation accurate and in the right way.</p> <p>When this step is behind, the final action is required - to pay for the video translation service and wait for the outcome. And the great news is that all the video translation processes are entirely automatized.</p> <h2> <strong>Additional services to improve translation from Portuguese to English</strong> </h2> <p>Considering the high competition level in the market, it is not enough to rely on AI-based software only. Therefore, VidBy has a few developments in progress to improve the quality of the translation from Portuguese to English and vice versa.</p> <h3><strong>A multitude of emotions</strong></h3> <p>The first development is based on assigning different emotions to the video transition. Obviously, all the translated videos will be unnatural and sound robotic without emotions. And with this idea in mind, the developers from VidBy have started to develop the possibility of using the following specter of emotions:</p> <ul> <li> Anger;</li> <li>Disgust;</li> <li>Joy;</li> <li>Surprise;</li> <li>Fear;</li> <li>Sadness.</li> </ul> <p>With the help of these emotions, your videos will be natural and be able to convey the message properly</p> <h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3> <p>The second significant development is a speech synthesizer. This innovative technology allows translation into different voices. It means that you can both assign the voices of males and females according to their age. It means that it is getting easier to generate the voices of children, teenagers, adults, and seniors.</p> <h2> <strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong> </h2> <p>These additional services are great, but a few more things need to be mentioned - even more benefits of using the services of VidBy.</p> <h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3> <p>Time always matters, and whether you are a business owner or a film studio owner, you understand what is the case here. VidBy uses its AI-based algorithm to translate a video from Portuguese to English (English to Portuguese). And with the help of this algorithm, the time is not an issue because the delivery time of the final result (a translated and dubbed video) is impressive. This delivery time is 1,000 times faster compared to other companies that rely mostly on people rather than technology.</p> <h3> <strong>Guaranteed quality of translation</strong> </h3> <p>Even though time always matters, there is a need to pay attention to the quality of the video translation as well. Thanks to the innovative algorithm, the quality of any video translation remains at a high level. And if you need proof, you can visit the official website of VidBy and check the examples of the translated videos for your own. And what is important, all the processes are completely automatized.</p> <h3><strong>Low cost</strong></h3> <p>There is always a need to save some money, and VidBy allows you and your company to do this. Instead of using the traditional video translation services that may be extremely expensive because of the necessity to hire real industry professionals, you can make an order and translate any video from Portuguese to English or vice versa while using the AI-based software at VidBy. Definitely, you will save hundreds or thousands of dollars.</p> <h3><strong>Different subscriptions</strong></h3> <p>Different customers need different service packages. And VidBy is ready to offer three subscriptions that will be suitable for people with their purposes.</p> <ul><li>Basis. It is a subscription for those who deal with short videos and do not need to assign multiple voices (one voice will be enough).</li><li>Extended. This package fits great for people with a need to deal with longer videos, more voices, video synch, and support.</li><li>Professional. This subscription is the best choice for the most demanding customers who want to get the maximum from the service.</li></ul> <h3><strong>Editing of transcripts</strong></h3> <p>The members of the Professional subscription get a unique opportunity to edit the transcripts.
