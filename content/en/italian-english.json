However, making a video for locals is not that difficult compared to the translation and dubbing of the video in different languages. This issue lies in the inability to overcome a language barrier, especially when it is all about the language pair of Italian and English.</p>\n<p>VidBy is an innovative platform that allows you to overcome the language barrier and how to translate a video from Italian to English and in the opposite direction with ease.</p>\n<h2><strong>The popularity and specification of the language pair</strong></h2>\n<p>Both languages are trendy. For English, it is an apparent reason because over one billion people can understand and speak it. Italian is less popular, but around 65 million people use Italian as their first and second language. And it is always great to have 65+ million people of a new audience.</p>\n<p>It is also a well-known fact that Italian is the language of love, and with the help of this lovely language is getting easier to expand your influential horizons. However, this language is not that easy; you can imagine and have many specifications based on cultural characteristics. But VidBy can handle all the complexities and specifics of the languages while translating and dubbing videos.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to translate from Italian to English: The algorithm of work</strong></h2>\n<p>Usually, all processes related to the video translation and dubbing from Italian into English are complicated. But it is not the case for VidBy. The video and audio translation platform VidBy uses innovative technology based on the implementation of artificial intelligence, which allows applying a simple algorithm.</p>\n<p>First of all, it is necessary to put a link to a video you wish to translate or upload to the service. It is a mandatory measure because, without a video, it will be impossible to do the translation and dubbing.</p>\n<p>When the process of uploading/putting the direct link is successful, it has become possible to go to the next step - to specify your order. It means that you need to indicate the original language of the video, the language that you want to translate and dub your video into, choose the voice or voices you want to assign, etc.</p>\n<p>The last thing remaining is to pay for the video translation services. During the step of providing the specific details, the service calculates and estimates the total price that you need to pay. The final numbers depend on the chosen parameters.</p>\n<p>And after successful payment, the service starts translating and dubbing your video.</p>\n<h2><strong>Additional features of VidBy</strong></h2>\n<p>The algorithm to translate Italian video to English is a piece of cake, and everyone can go through all of these simple steps. But to provide you with a stunning result, VidBy has put another measure - the implementation of additional features that aim to better the quality of video translation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Add a drop of emotions</strong></h3>\n<p>Many videos have a lack of emotions. And the development team of VidBy has taken this moment into account. From now, it is possible to add several emotions to the dubbed videos. The list is not that impressive but still includes the demanding emotions, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Joy;</li>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Anger;</li>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Fear;</li>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Sadness;</li>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Disgust;</li>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Surprise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the help of this emotional specter, it is getting easier to make the translated and dubbed videos from Italian into English and vice versa.</p>\n<h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3>\n<p>It is worth also highlighting that VidBy applies the technology of a speech synthesizer. In general, this term refers to a technology that allows generating translation with the use of voices by different generations, namely the voices of children, teenagers, adults, and seniors.</p>\n<p>This feature helps transmit your message more accurately and diversify your video content with different voices.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the benefits of working with us?</strong></h2>\n<p>For sure, the features mentioned above will surprise you, but there are a few more things that you can take advantage of.</p>\n<h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3>\n<p>The first thing to highlight is the speedy delivery time of the video translation.

And the additional features make the translated videos more realistic.</p>\n<h3><strong>Low cost</strong></h3>\n<p>Talking about the cost of the services, it is worth noting that the total price will be ten times lower compared to the price of other video translation services.
