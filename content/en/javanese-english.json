Moreover, you will see what this innovative service can provide you with and the benefits you can take. But firstly, it is worth getting to know this language pair better. </p> <h2> <strong>The popularity and complexities of the language pair (Javanese-English)</strong> </h2> <p>Talking about this language pair, you probably know a lot about English. And it is not surprising because this language is the king of languages and is spoken by over 1.6 billion people globally. Due to its widespread popularity and usage, there are 160 dialects of the language, which are a real pain for translators and people who deal with this sphere.</p> <p>The second language of this pair is Javanese. It is an official language for the people living in Indonesia, particularly on the island of Java (from here, the name of the language). According to the statistics, the number of native speakers consists of 92 million people. One of the most challenging complexities of the language is that it features three levels, which are used for different purposes (one level to communicate with older people, another level for communication with people you respect, and the last one - the communication with your friends).</p> <p>For the video translation service VidBy is not that difficult to distinguish all these levels and make a video translate Javanese to English in the most understandable way.</p> <h2><strong>The algorithm of work: How to translate a video from Javanese to English at VidBy?</strong></h2> <p>The video translation service VidBy takes advantage of available advanced technologies, which are essentially based on artificial intelligence. Thanks to these technologies, all the process of dubbing and translating from Javanese to English and in the opposite direction is wholly automatized. However, you need to do a few things to get the result required. </p> <p>Initially, uploading a video you want to translate from one language to another is essential. You can also link directly to the video and click on the Start button. After that, you will be asked to clarify the order’s details. And finally, you need to download the translated and dubbed video on your device. </p> <p>So, you see that the working algorithm is not complicated, and what is more important, you do not have to do almost anything to get a translated video from Javanese to English.</p> <h2> <strong>Additional services to improve translation from Javanese to English</strong> </h2> <p>To provide customers with astonishing results,  the Javanese to English translation video service VidBy has developed a few exciting and, at the same time, valuable features that are designed to improve the quality of any translation. Let us consider them in more detail. </p> <h3><strong>A multitude of emotions</strong></h3> <p>One of the essential things that every translated video should have is the presence of emotions. Therefore, while using the service VidBy, you can count on six emotions that can be assigned to different people’s voices. The initial pool of the emotions is not that huge and includes: </p> <ul> <li> Anger;</li> <li>Disgust;</li> <li>Joy;</li> <li>Surprise;</li> <li>Fear;</li> <li>Sadness.</li> </ul> <p>This starter pack is just the beginning and the ground for something bigger. But for this stage of development, it should be enough. </p> <h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3> <p>A speech synthesizer is the second valuable development that helps translated videos have a natural and realistic sound. This innovative tool allows you to generate different voices for different people. For instance, you can easily give a child a child’s voice. </p> <h2> <strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong> </h2> <p>In addition to these innovative tools, the video translation service VidBy provides its customers with several benefits. And with the help of these benefits, it is getting easier to have an honestly positive experience with VidBy. </p> <h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3> <p>For most businesses, universities, governmental bodies, and other institutions, the exceptional speed of the delivery of the translation from Javanese to English or in the opposite direction is one of the critical points. Knowing this, VidBy and its innovative advanced technology with additional supportive tools can translate video Javanese to English 1,000 times faster compared to other video translation services with the traditional approach on the board. To calculate the estimated time for yourself, you need to double the time of the total length of the original video. </p> <h3> <strong>Guaranteed quality of translation</strong> </h3> <p>Knowing that the Javanese to English translation video service VidBy guarantees an exceptional delivery time of any video translation, you may have doubts about the quality of the video translation there.

On the official website, you can watch the translated videos from Javanese to English and vice versa and decide on your own.</p> <h3><strong>Low cost</strong></h3> <p>While many traditional video translation services rely mostly on real people, their services cost a lot of money (one translation can cost you hundreds or even thousands of dollars). And it is not that good to spend a lot of money, especially if there is an option to cut off the expenses and save the money. It is possible at VidBy since all the translations are done by one software.</p> <h3><strong>Different subscriptions</strong></h3> <p>To give an option to save even more money, you can purchase one out of three subscriptions that are specifically and thoughtfully designed for different purposes.
