However, it is not that easy to convey the message correctly when dealing with a foreign language, especially when we are talking about not a typical pair - Bengali and English. In this case, the language barrier problem arises.</p> <p>To overcome the issue and deliver your message correctly (that everyone will be able to understand every single word properly), it is necessary to use professional translating services, like VidBy.</p> <p>We will dedicate this article to the topic of online Bengali to English translation video processes and vice versa, explain to you the working algorithm of translation and dub, and give you several reasons why you should consider VidBy. So, let us look at the language pair of Bengali and English first.</p> <h2> <strong>The popularity and complexities of the language pair (Bengali-English)</strong> </h2> <p>First, it is worth indicating that English is the most spoken language globally. Over one billion people on the Earth can speak and understand this language. It has complexities in grammar and dialects (Canadian English, Australian English, etc.). And it is crucially important to know the dialect to make the translation clear and understandable.</p> <p>On another side of the language pair is Bengali. It is the official language of the citizens of Bangladesh, and at least 164 million people can fluently speak it. The complexity of the language lies in morphology (verbs can be inflected for different things, like persons, tenses, etc.).</p> <p>And if there is a need to translate Bengali video to English, the nice way to solve the problem is through the professional video translator VidBy.</p> <h2><strong>The algorithm of work: How to translate from Bengali to English at VidBy?</strong></h2> <p>You probably think about the traditional approach of translating and dubbing videos from Bengali to English when many professional translators and artists are involved. However, it is a completely different process if we touch on the services of VidBy.</p> <p>First, an innovative AI-based algorithm translates and dubs any video within the frame of this language pair. It is necessary to provide this algorithm with a video, which is needed to be translated and dubbed, specify some details, and wait for the result.</p> <p>As practice shows, the translation is faster than the traditional translation agencies, where you need to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on hiring experts, and all outcomes are of excellent quality. Such high quality became possible because of the several additional services that VidBy offers.</p> <h2> <strong>Additional services to improve translation from Bengali to English</strong> </h2> <p>So many video translation services provide their customers with different solutions. However, most of the solutions are already outdated or make a kind of a robotic translation. So, VidBy has a few things that change your mind about the quality of the video translate Bengali to English service.</p> <h3><strong>A multitude of emotions</strong></h3> <p>To get rid of the “robotic” pronunciation (in dubbing), it is necessary to make it as realistic as possible. And the only proven way to do this is to apply emotions while people express their feelings. At the current stage, the development team has been working on the following group of emotions:</p> <ul> <li> Anger;</li> <li>Disgust;</li> <li>Joy;</li> <li>Surprise;</li> <li>Fear;</li> <li>Sadness.</li> </ul> <p>So, in the future, your videos will be diluted with them, and all your video will sound more natural. This list is not impressive, but the developers are working on it.</p> <h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3> <p>The second product of the Bengali to English translation video service that is worth considering is the speech synthesizer. It means that the AI-based can generate different voices assigned to different people (male/female). But the developers have gone further and made it possible to use the voices of children, teenagers, adults, and seniors.</p> <h2> <strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong> </h2> <p>Besides the additional products that VidBy offers to its customers, a few more benefits are worth highlighting.</p> <h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3> <p>Whether you are a business owner, video producer, or someone who needs to translate Bengali video to English or vice versa, the time of delivery and the outcome result always matter. The VidBy video translation service relies on AI-based software that makes it possible to translate and dub any video from Bengali to English (English to Bengali) 1,000 times faster than traditional video translation services.</p> <h3> <strong>Guaranteed quality of translation</strong> </h3> <p>It is not surprising that you have some doubts about the quality of the video translation, but that is not the case. The quality of the video translation is fascinating. Artificial intelligence, in combination with the additional developments of the company (speech synthesizer and addition of emotions), guarantee the result you are waiting for. If you do not believe in it, you can always check the samples of any video translate Bengali to English work or other language pair and make sure for yourself.</p> <h3><strong>Low cost</strong></h3> <p>The video translation services of the AI-based software, which VidBy uses, cost less than the same services for the video translation and dub at the companies with the traditional approach to the video translation. You can save up to 10 times less and spend money on something else or some more translations.</p> <h3><strong>Different subscriptions</strong></h3> <p>VidBy takes care of its customers and provides them with three different subscriptions that can help them save even more money. The subscriptions (Basis, Extended, and Professional) have different packages of the services, which depend on the customers’ needs only. If you need to translate a video from Bangali to English or vice versa with a small total length, the subscription of Basis will be suitable for this purpose. Suppose you regularly deal with the video translation and dub. In that case, it is worth paying attention to the Professional subscriptions, which give customers more of the total length of time and unlock some unique features.</p> <h3><strong>Editing of transcripts</strong></h3> <p>All members of the Professional subscription can count on the unique feature of an edition of transcripts. At first sight, it seems like not a necessary tool, but this assumption is wrong. With the help of this tool, you can improve the quality of your videos.</p> <h2><strong>How to get a translated video from Bengali to English</strong></h2> <p>If you need or wish to translate video Bengali to English, you need to understand and go through three simple and straightforward steps.</p> <ul> <li>Step #1 - Original video.
