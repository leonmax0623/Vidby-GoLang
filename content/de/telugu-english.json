Many international companies, universities, governmental bodies, and other institutions or persons use videos to reach new audiences or enter new markets. However, the language barrier is the only problem that divides you and the new global audience. So, the online video translator VidBy is your problem-solver that can translate and dub in multiple languages, especially if you need to translate Telugu video to English. </p> <p>In this article, you will learn more about this language pair and the most effective way to make dub and translation. In addition, we will reveal to you all the ups and downs of this video translation company. </p> <h2> <strong>The popularity and specification of the language pair (Telugu-English)</strong> </h2> <p>On the one hand, we have English, a language spoken by over 1.6 billion people globally (over 400 million native speakers of the language). It is a language with an exciting and long-way history with over 160 dialects. And these dialects are the primary pain for every video translator because of specific colloquialisms, local jargonic expressions, idioms (that cannot be translated in the word-by-word order), and ambiguity in meanings.</p> <p>On the other hand, we have Telugu, the official language for the citizens of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (some Indian states). It means that 82 million people are native speakers of this language. And additionally, 3 million people use Telugu as their second language. According to Ethnologue, it ranks as the 15th language by the number of native speakers. The main problem of the language (from the perspective of a video and voice translator) is that the declension of nouns in the literal and colloquial languages is different.</p> <p>To overcome this issue, it is necessary to use the video translation service VidBy, which does not think this issue is an issue.</p> <h2><strong>The algorithm of work: How to translate a video from Telugu to English at VidBy?</strong></h2> <p>The Telugu to English translation video service VidBy does not see any problem in translating and dubbing videos from Telugu to English or in the opposite direction. These processes are entirely automatized because the AI-based software is in charge, and you need to do only a few things to translate your videos. </p> <p>It is necessary to put a link to a video you want to translate and dub or just upload the video from your device. Then, the video translation service will request you to provide it with some additional information related to the translation itself. It means you need to specify your order. </p> <p>When all the specific information is provided, the video translation service initiates the process of dubbing and translating. The only thing that remains is the waiting time, after which you can download the translated video.</p> <h2> <strong>The additional services to improve the translation from Telugu to English</strong> </h2> <p>Understandably, it is not enough to use the innovative technology only to translate video Telugu to English to get great results in terms of dubbing and translating. With this thought in mind, the development team of VidBy has started to develop additional products (tools) to make all the translations better and of good quality.</p> <h3><strong>A multitude of emotions</strong></h3> <p>The first innovative development touches on the topic of adding emotions to the translated videos. Without expression of emotions, all videos will be too monotonous and inconvenient. And that is why you can apply the following feelings to your videos:</p> <ul> <li> Anger;</li> <li>Disgust;</li> <li>Joy;</li> <li>Surprise;</li> <li>Fear;</li> <li>Sadness.</li> </ul> <p>The list of emotions is not that extensive. But, it is better than nothing, and it is just the beginning - shortly, this list will be added with more options to assign to translate video Telugu to English, which will sound realistic and natural. </p> <h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3> <p>The second development is a speech synthesizer. This innovative technology allows the AI-based software to generate different voices giving them gender and age diversification. Thus, assigning the voices of children, teenagers, adults, and seniors to the persons on your videos is getting easier. This tool can improve any video translation from Tegulu to English.  </p> <h2> <strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong> </h2> <p>In addition to the additional products that VidBy provides its customers with, there are a few more surprising and pleasant benefits. These benefits have a straightforward goal to make your experience with the video translation service of VidBy as positive and memorable as possible. </p> <h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3> <p>For some people, the speed of the translation from Tegulu to English (or from English to Tegulu) is one of the key factors. Thanks to the AI-based technology that makes this video translation happen, the translation is done 1,000 times faster than other services that offer the same video translation services but with the traditional approach on the board. To calculate this time for yourself, you can use the formula: multiply the total length of the video, which needs to be translated and dubbed, by two. The received digits will give you a noticeable hint of how much time you need to wait until the service completes this process.</p> <h3> <strong>Guaranteed quality of translation</strong> </h3> <p>Another benefit that will be a plus for you is that the quality of the translation is not lost. This innovative and advanced technology works together with the additional tools designed to improve the quality of the video translate Telugu to English. Thus, all the translated videos have an emotional tone and natural assignation of the voices.</p> <h3><strong>Low cost</strong></h3> <p>It is a well-known truth that it is necessary to hire people (professional translators and artists) to translate and dub any video from Tegulu to English or vice versa. It is not cheap, especially when we are talking about this language pair. The Telugu to English translation video service VidBy allows you to reduce the expenses since the only thing that should be hired is the AI-based software with the additional products in the complect.</p> <h3><strong>Different subscriptions</strong></h3> <p>One more thing that helps you to cut the expenses while translating videos from Tegulu to English (from English to Tegulu) is the opportunity to pick one out of three available subscriptions (Basis, Extended, and Professional). All these subscriptions are explicitly designed for customers with different purposes and demands.</p> <p>All these subscriptions are differentiated by the maximum length of the original/translated videos, the number of voices to assign, and special features.</p> <h3><strong>Editing of transcripts</strong></h3> <p>The members of the Professional subscription can use the helpful feature of the video translation service - an option to edit transcripts.
