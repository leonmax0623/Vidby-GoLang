However, when you are trying to convey the main message in your video from one language to another, the problem of the language barrier occurs, especially when you are dealing with the language pair of Romanian and English.</p> <p>In this article, you will get to know the video translator VidBy, which is an excellent problem-solver in this regard. Moreover, you will find the answer to how to translate a video from Romanian to English?</p> <h2> <strong>The popularity and complexities of the language pair (Romanian-English)</strong> </h2> <p>Considering this language pair, English does not need any introduction because, among 7.73 billion people, over 1.5 billion can speak and understand this language fluently. The only complexity of the language lies in an extensive list of dialects because there are at least 160 of them.</p> <p>On the contrary, you have Romanian, an official language for the citizens of Romania and Moldovia. Approximately 26 million people speak this language. From this point, it is obvious that Romanian is not as popular as English. This language is not difficult to learn (the US Foreign Service Institute ranks this language as the easiest one to learn), but the lack of translators is a massive problem. So, how to translate a video from Romanian to English if there is a lack of specialists?</p> <h2><strong>The algorithm of work: How to translate a video from Romanian to English at VidBy?</strong></h2> <p>VidBy provides its qualified and innovative solution to solve the translation problem from Romanian to English and vice versa. And this solution is too easy to understand the working algorithm of the translation process (from the customer's perspective).</p> <p>First and foremost, the service requires an original video that will be consequently translated. When you have provided VidBy with the video, you click on the Start button and will be requested to specify the order's details.</p> <p>During the next step, it is mandatory to pay for the video translating and dubbing services first. Otherwise, the service will not initiate the process.</p> <p>And finally, you need to wait until the AI-based software translates and dubs the given video. Usually, it takes not so much time, but this time depends on the total length of the video.</p> <h2> <strong>Additional service to improve translation from Romanian to English</strong> </h2> <p>To make the service even more valuable, VidBy has developed a few additional products that are intended to improve the quality of the video. So, let us take a close look at them.</p> <h3><strong>A multitude of emotions</strong></h3> <p>It is a well-known truth that every translated video should have emotions (or at least some sort of), and the developers at VidBy understand this importance. Thus, in the current development plan, there is a technology that allows adding multiple emotions to the video translated from Romanian to English. This technology cannot boast an extensive list of emotions and have only the following ones:</p> <ul> <li> Anger;</li> <li>Disgust;</li> <li>Joy;</li> <li>Surprise;</li> <li>Fear;</li> <li>Sadness.</li> </ul> <p>These six emotions are just ground, and in the near future, there will be more of them available for use.</p> <h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3> <p>The next product is a speech synthesizer. This product allows customers to apply different voices, whether it is the voice of a male or female. But the developers have gone further and made it possible to assign the voices of different people divided by age (the voices of children, teenagers, adults, and seniors). And it is a nice product if your goal is to translate Romanian audio from video online to English, which will sound natural.</p> <h2> <strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong> </h2> <p>The additional products to improve the translation quality are great, but it is still worth getting to know the benefits of working with VidBy. The video translation service gives you a few advantages that you can take easily.</p> <h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3> <p>The first advantage of VidBy is the incredible speed of the delivery. You can translate Romanian audio from video online 1,000 faster than other video translation services and agencies. This phenomenal speed is caused by the implemented innovative software, primarily based on artificial intelligence. And the reduction of this time is since computers make the translation and dub faster than humans.</p> <h3> <strong>Guaranteed quality of translation</strong> </h3> <p>The second advantage of the service is the exceedingly good quality of the video translation from Romanian to English and in the opposite direction. Although the translation and dub are done by a computer (the AI-based software), you will not see a significant difference between this translation and the translation done with the help of the traditional approach (where people are involved).</p> <h3><strong>Low cost</strong></h3> <p>As all the work is done by one complex AI-based software, you can highlight the next benefit - reducing costs on the same services. While the traditional approach requires payment for different specialists (voice and video translators), you must pay for one program. And this moment significantly helps you save hundreds and thousands of dollars. And what is great, you will get the same quality of the translated video from Romanian to English.</p> <h3><strong>Different subscriptions</strong></h3> <p>The next stop is for the customers who deal with a need for video translation and dub from Romanian to English regularly. VidBy has three subscriptions that are suitable for customers with different purposes. Among these subscriptions are:</p> <ul> <li>Basis; </li> <li>Extended;</li> <li>Professional.</li> </ul> <p>From their name, it is clear that the Basis plan fits better for not demanding customers who can only make do with one voice.
