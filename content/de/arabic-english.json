And the first problem that appears immediately is the difficulties while translating and dubbing the videos in different languages. In this short article, we will talk about the language pair of Russian and English, how to translate a video from Russian to English, and the benefits of working with a video translator VidBy.</p>\n<h2><strong>The popularity and specification of the language pair</strong></h2>\n<p>Both languages are globally used, and they do not need any introduction. However, it is worth indicating that these languages, in some or another way, are complex ones and have their specifications.</p>\n<p>To remind you, English is the language used by over a billion people, so it is pretty evident why it is so popular. And there are 160 distinct English dialects around the globe.</p>\n<pArabic is the fifth’s most spoken language, with an audience of 313 million people. This language is not that extended and consists of 30 dialects in terms of dialects. However, it is recognized as one of the most challenging languages to learn (it stays on the same level as Japanese and Chinese).</p>\n<p>The main problem with this language pair in translating and dubbing videos is the lack of specialists who can do this task properly. And that is why their services are costly. But the solution is here - VidBy. This onlin platform can translate Arabic video to English with ease and way cheaper. So, let us dive deeper and know about the algorithm of this video and audio translation service better.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to translate from Arabic to English: The algorithm of work</strong></h2>\n<p>The VidBy platform allows everyone to process Arabic to English video translation and dubbing.

It is also possible to put a direct link to the video and go to the next stage - to specify the details of your order.</p>\n<p>On the appeared page, you will see different lines that should be filled in. It is required to clarify some moments, including the original language of the video, the language of the final result, assigned voices, the format of the video after the translation, etc.</p>\n<p>On the appeared page, you will see different lines that should be filled in.
