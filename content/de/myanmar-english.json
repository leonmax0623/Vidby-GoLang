Everyone likes videos, especially when they are exciting and understandable. But it is always complicated to correctly deliver your message to a large group of people in another language- the language barrier problem. And if we consider such a language pair as Myanmar and English, this problem is getting worse and worse because of the different factors.</p> <p>In this article, we will give you an excellent solution to this problem - the online video translator VidBy, which makes it possible to dub and translate video Myanmar to English and vice versa and deliver the message in the right way. </p> <h2> <strong>The popularity and complexities of the language pair (Myanmar-English)</strong> </h2> <p>This language pair is a tough one to deal with. Even though English is one of the most spoken languages globally, Myanmar is the language of the minority. Only 50 million people know this language, and this number is nothing compared to the languages like German, French, Hindi, etc.</p> <p>The specification of Myanmar lies in the non-standard romanization and the limited use of the loan words (from English). Besides these aspects, the language is complex even for experienced linguists. It means that there are a few specialists who are capable of translating and dub videos within the frame of this language pair. But the solution always exists - VidBy.</p> <h2><strong>The algorithm of work: How to translate from Myanmar to English at VidBy?</strong></h2> <p>VidBy is a video translation service that can quickly help you dub and translate Myanmar video to English and vice versa. However, it is always interesting to know how the video translation algorithm works (from a customer’s perspective).</p> <p>At the first point, it is necessary to give the service, which is based on AI technology, a video that is needed to be translated. You can do it with the help of a direct link (just put the link in a particular line on the main page of the official website) or upload the video from your personal device (a tablet, smartphone, or desktop).</p> <p>Secondly, providing the video translation service with specific information related to the translation from Myanmar to English is mandatory. This information includes:</p> <ul> <li>The original language of the video (English or Myanmar) - it is possible to select a specific dialect;</li> <li> The language you wish to translate your video into (Myanmar or English) - it is possible to select a specific dialect;</li> <li>The voice settings (the number of voices and their gender);</li> <li>The video (MP4/MKV) and audio (MP3/WAV) track format.</li> </ul> <p>The third stage requires making a payment. You can choose Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, GooglePay, ApplePay, or CashTime. You will see the total amount of money you need to pay at the stage of providing the service with specific information about the video.</p> <p>And the most “complicated” stage is to wait until the AI-based advanced software translates the video from Myanmar to English. This information can be seen on the right side of the page (the same page with the specification information).</p> <p>And it is the complete working algorithm of the video translation service VidBy. But it is not simple and straightforward as you may assume.</p> <h2> <strong>Additional services to improve the video translation from Myanmar to English</strong> </h2> <p>The Myanmar to English translation video service has a few additional features that make any audio and video translation from Myanmar to English (from English to Myanmar) more realistic.</p> <h3><strong>A multitude of emotions</strong></h3> <p>It is a well-known and widespread truth that innovative video translation services cannot provide their customers with realistic voices in the videos.

It is an innovative technology that allows AI-based software to generate the voices of people of different ages. There are four most common age groups:</p> <ol> <li>Children;</li> <li>Teenagers;</li> <li>Adults;</li> <li>Seniors.</li> </ol> <p>In combination with the speech synthesizer, the development of emotions makes excellent sense, and it is the right direction to follow to reach the needed result shortly.</p> <h2> <strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong> </h2> <p>To know the additional products that the video translation service works on is great, but to see the rest of the benefits, which help do a video translate Myanmar to English process more pleasant, is a way exciting.</p> <h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3> <p>While most traditional video translation agencies and companies offer their qualified services, VidBy is way ahead of them regarding the delivery speed of any translation from Myanmar to English and in the opposite direction.</p> <p>The traditional services make the translation and dub with the help of real people.
