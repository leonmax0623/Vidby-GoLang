One of the proven ways to share your thoughts, ideas, and messages is through videos. So, the issue of the problem lies in the inability to translate into many different languages. VidBy has tried to remove the language barrier and wanted that videos can be easily and quickly translated, especially when we are talking about a complicated language pair of Spanish-English and how to translate a video from Spanish to English or vice versa.</p>\n<h2><strong>The popularity and specification of the language pair</strong></h2>\n<p>Spanish is the language spoken by over 500 million people around the globe, and it is evident that there is a need to translate videos from Spanish to English or to make it in the opposite side - English to Spanish. However, it is not that easy to do this, especially knowing that not everyone learns English or Spanish. What is more, Spanish is not a simple language and has different dialects that should be considered before translating videos. The challenge here is the difficulty in finding translators and artists who can help you reach the goal.</p>\n<p>English is the world&rsquo;s first language in terms of popularity, and over 1.35 billion people know and speak it. However, the problem is that not everyone can speak and understand both languages (Spanish and English). That is why VidBy has joined the game. But firstly, you need to find out how to translate Spanish video to English.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to translate from Spanish to English: The algorithm of work</strong></h2>\n<p>The translation is done with the help of special software that has a unique algorithm. But before this algorithm starts to work, it is necessary to do a few actions.</p>\n<p>The first action is to give the service a link to the video that is needed to be translated from Spanish to English or vice versa or simply upload the video. After that, you need to specify your order that the software can take into account while translating your videos. And finally, it is mandatory to pay for the video translation so that the algorithm can initiate the process.</p>\n<p>When the algorithm makes the work done, it will inform you and give a link to the video. So, you know the answer to the question - how to translate a video from Spanish to English, so can easily handle it.</p>\n<h2><strong>Additional features of the video translation services of VidBy</strong></h2>\n<p>The auto process of translation is a great thing about VidBy, but a few more features can impress you, and you can take advantage of them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Add a drop of emotions</strong></h3>\n<p>Most software products, which translate Spanish video to English and vice versa, make translations accurate. However, these translations sound like monotonic speeches without having an emotional tone. VidBy translation service allows its customers to get translated videos with different emotions. At the current stage of development, it is possible to apply the translation of the following emotions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Anger;</li>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Joy;</li>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Fear;</li>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Disgust;</li>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Sadness;</li>\n<li> &nbsp; &nbsp; Surprise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, the list is short, but the development team has constantly worked on its expansion.</p>\n<h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3>\n<p>The second remarkable feature of the VidBy video translator Spanish to English service is the feature of a speech synthesizer. Putting this term into simple words, the speech synthesizer means an artificial production of a human voice. It is possible to use the voice of a child, a teenager, an adult, or a senior. And this option adds a more realistic feeling to the translated video from Spanish to English and English to Spanish.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong></h2>\n<p>You see that VidBy puts a lot of effort into developing its translating services. Still, it is worth highlighting the benefits you get while using the video translation service from Spanish to English.</p>\n<h3><strong>Quick translation results</strong></h3>\n<p>Time always matters, and delivery time means a lot for the people who want to reach a global community. So, these people think about how to translate Spanish video to English faster. And the solution is right here - VidBy.

Consequently, you will save a lot of time and receive a high-quality video translation.</p>\n<h3><strong>Guaranteed quality of the services</strong></h3>\n<p>You probably have thoughts that artificial intelligence cannot make the translation from Spanish to English properly.
