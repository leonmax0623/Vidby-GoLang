And it is the easiest thing to distribute the video on the web, but it is challenging to translate and dub these videos into different languages. And if we are talking about the language pair such as Persian and English, the chances of success are getting lower and lower because it is complicated to find specialists who will help you with this issue.</p> <p>In this article, we will get to know you with the solution to the problem and explain how to translate Persian video to English and vice versa without any difficulties and at an affordable price.</p> <h2> <strong>The popularity and specification of the language pair (Persian-English)</strong> </h2> <p>The language pair of Persian and English is not famous, and that is why it is a real challenge to find reliable and qualified specialists or services that help to make a translation and dub. But if we talk about both of these languages separately, it gives you a clear picture.</p> <p>Without any doubt, English is the most popular and spoken language on the entire Earth. Over 1.5 billion people can communicate while using this language, and among this number, 400+ million are native speakers. Since so many people know the language, there are 162 different dialects of it, which is one of the well-known complexities of the video translation.</p> <p>Persian is a language used mainly by the citizens of Afghanistan, Iran, and Tajikistan. The approximate number of speakers of this language is around 110 million people. The primary complexity of this language (in terms of translation) is the language ambiguities, processing idioms, and slang.</p> <p>And there are not so many specialists (video and voice translators) who are capable of dealing with this language pair. That is why it is worth trying to use the services of the online video translator VidBy, which is your problem-solver.</p> <h2><strong>The algorithm of work: How to translate a video from Persian to English at VidBy?</strong></h2> <p>While dealing with the issue of video translation, it is always interesting to know how to translate a video from Persian to English and vice versa with the help of the innovative solutions presented by the Persian to English translation video service VidBy. From the customer's perspective, this process is elementary and pretty understandable. </p> <p>Initially, it is necessary to provide the service with the original video, which should be translated. After doing this, it is mandatory to make it clear for the service and specify some moments, like the original language of the video, the language you want to use to translate the video, etc. When you are ready with this, the only thing remains: wait until the AI-based software is ready with video translation and dub, and you can download the video.</p> <h2> <strong>The additional services to improve the translation from Persian to English</strong> </h2> <p>To improve the quality of any video translate Persian to English outcome, the development team has come up with several interesting and valuable ideas that help the primary AI-based software give more than satisfactory results to the customers.</p> <h3><strong>A multitude of emotions</strong></h3> <p>It is not surprising that one of the essential things that every video translation should have is emotion. With the help of emotions, it is easy to build an emotional connection between you and your target audience. Thus, while using the Persian to English translation video service VidBy, you can find a special additional service that allows you to apply different emotions to the translated videos and make these videos more natural. Among these emotions are:</p> <ul> <li> Anger;</li> <li>Disgust;</li> <li>Joy;</li> <li>Surprise;</li> <li>Fear;</li> <li>Sadness.</li> </ul> <p>Currently, the list of emotions is limited, but the developers will extend it and add more emotions.</p> <h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3> <p>Another useful tool to improve the quality of the videos is a speech synthesizer. The speech synthesizer has one single goal: to generate different people's voices. It means that if you have a speaking male or female on the video, it is required to assign a male or female voice, respectively. In addition, you can also assign the voices of children, teenagers, adults, and seniors. And consequently, all the videos will sound realistic.</p> <h2> <strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong> </h2> <p>Besides these additional services that VidBy offers its customers, it is also worth paying attention to the additional benefits that come with the video translation service. </p> <h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3> <p>Everyone wants to make a video translate Persian to English and vice versa in the fastest possible way.
