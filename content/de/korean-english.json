But it is getting complicated to make videos that will be understandable for people who are outside the frame of your native language, so the language barrier is an immense pain.

What is more, we will explain to you how all these translation processes work. But let us get started with the language pair as our first stop.</p> <h2> <strong>The popularity and specification of the language pair (Korean-English)</strong> </h2> <p>English is the most prominent representative of this pair.

From its name, it is clear that it is an official language for the citizens of Korea, to be more specific - South and North Korea. It means that about 80 million people can speak it. There is no proven statistics of how many people can speak and understand this language fluently, considering the global scale. According to the Foreign Service Institute, Korean belongs to the 5th category and ranks as one of the most difficult languages to learn for English speakers.

However, VidBy can help you with this issue.</p> <h2><strong>The algorithm of work: How to translate a video from Korean to English at VidBy?</strong></h2> <p>VidBy is a video translation service that allows you to translate video Korean to English and in the opposite direction effortlessly.
