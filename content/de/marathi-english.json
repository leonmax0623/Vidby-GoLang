But to make a video available for everybody, it is necessary to translate it and dub it from the original language to the needed one. Otherwise, the viewers will not understand anything. </p> <p>In this article, we will deal with the language pair of Marathi and English and explain how to translate Marathi video to English and vice versa with the help of an innovative solution - the online video translator VidBy. However, it is worth learning something more about these languages. </p> <h2> <strong>The popularity and specification of the language pair (Marathi-English)</strong> </h2> <p>The first language within this pair is English. It is the world’s most spoken language, with over 400 million native speakers and over 1.1 billion people who are capable of understanding it to some extent. It is assumable that English is one language but has over 160 dialects. And these dialects are the most challenging part for professional translators.</p> <p>The next language of the pair is Marathi. This language is officially used by the citizens of Maharashtra, a region in India. Over 80 million people use this language as their mother tongue, and around 12 million use it as their second language. Moreover, this language ranks as the tenth language with the most native speakers. And the most challenging thing for the voice translator from Marathi to English is understanding the regional dialect.</p> <p>In the video translation market, there are not so many experienced translators who can deal with this language pair properly, and these translators’ services are costly. But there is always a solution - VidBy.</p> <h2><strong>The algorithm of work: How to translate a video from Marathi to English?</strong></h2> <p>The video translation service of VidBy allows you to translate Marathi videos into English without any problem. And what is more important, the video translation process is entirely automatized. However, you still will be asked to contribute to this process. </p> <p>First of all, it is mandatory to provide the video translation service with a video you wish to translate video Marathi to English (or from English to Marathi). It is an obvious step because, without the original video, VidBy will not be able to provide you with any translation. </p> <p>When you have done this, the second thing required is the specification of your request. It means you must give the video translation service some additional information, which will be used as a guideline. This information usually includes some basic data - the specification of the original video’s language, the language needed to translate the video, the assignation of different voices, and a few more parameters.</p> <p>After you have done these two steps, you need to wait some time (the estimated time of the video translation process can be calculated easily: double the time of the original video length) and download the video.</p> <h2> <strong>Additional services to improve the video translation from Marathi to English</strong> </h2> <p>To provide its customers with a professional video translation service that allows them to dub and translate video Marathi to English and in the opposite direction, VidBy has developed a few more additional services (tools) to improve the quality of the outcome results.</p> <h3><strong>A multitude of emotions</strong></h3> <p>The first useful development is a tool that allows applying different emotions to the translated videos while making them sound more natural and realistic (without the tone of the robotic/monotonous voice). The specter of emotions is the following:</p> <ul> <li> Anger;</li> <li>Disgust;</li> <li>Joy;</li> <li>Surprise;</li> <li>Fear;</li> <li>Sadness.</li> </ul> <p>In the near future, the developers of VidBy intend to add even more emotions to translate videos that will sound so good and without a hint of an automatized translation.</p> <h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3> <p>It is also worth mentioning the second valuable development of the Marathi to English translation video service VidBy - a speech synthesizer. This additional tool makes it possible to assign different voices depending on the customers’ needs. For instance, you have a speaking boy in your video, and it would sound stupid if this boy had a female voice of an adult. So, this tool allows assigning voices of both children, teenagers, adults, and seniors.</p> <h2> <strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong> </h2> <p>The advantages are not over at this point, and a few more things should be considered. The following benefits will help you get a truly positive experience with VidBy while having the needed results. </p> <h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3> <p>It is not surprising that delivery speed plays a crucial role in the work of any video translation service. And that is why VidBy offers an exceptional delivery speed. With the help of the AI-based software, which is in charge of the video translation processes, VidBy can make any video translate Marathi to English and vice versa 1,000 times faster compared to the video translation services that use the traditional approach of translating and dubbing.</p> <h3> <strong>Guaranteed quality of translation</strong> </h3> <p>The video translation service translates videos from Marathi to English and in the opposite direction 1,000 times faster than other similar services, but what about the quality of the translation? The AI-based software and the additional tools work together and in close cooperation with each other. And this cooperation guarantees the high quality of video translation.</p> <h3><strong>Low cost</strong></h3> <p>As mentioned earlier, VidBy relies on advanced technology and several additional tools to make any video translate Marathi to English better and of good quality. And thanks to this innovative complex, it is possible to reduce the costs to their minimum and get an affordable deal.</p> <h3><strong>Different subscriptions</strong></h3> <p>To save even more money, you can always take advantage of the subscriptions that VidBy offers to its customers. Three subscriptions are suitable for different customers with different needs. Among these subscriptions are:</p> <ul> <li>Basis;</li> <li>Extended;</li> <li>Professional.</li> </ul> <p>All these subscriptions are differentiated by the maximum length of the original/translated videos, the number of voices to assign, and special features.</p> <h3><strong>Editing of transcripts</strong></h3> <p>The option of editing transcripts, for instance, is only available for the customers who got the Professional subscription. With the help of it, you can increase the accuracy of the video translation to 100%.</p> <h2><strong>How to translate and dub a video from Marathi to English?</strong></h2> <p>If you need to translate a video at the Marathi to English translation video service VidBy, you need to go through a few simple but straightforward steps to make the translation done. </p> <ul> <li><strong>The first step.</strong>Make sure that you have provided the video translation service with a video that is needed to be translated. Without this video, it will be impossible to go on. You can do this with the help of a direct link to the video or upload the video from your device.</li> <li><strong>The second step.</strong>When the video translation service has the video, it needs some additional information to process it further. It means that you need to specify the language of the original video (including the dialect), the language of the outcome result, the audio and video formats, and several more parameters. </li> <li><strong>The third step.</strong>Before the video translation service starts to translate and dub your video, you need to pay for the service. The possible ways to make the payment are Visa, Mastercard, ApplePay, GooglePay, PayPal, and SWIFT transfer.    </li> <li>And <strong>fourth step</strong>Wait until the software translate your video from Marathi to English (from English to Marathi) and download the translated video on your device.</li> </ul> <h2> <strong>Conclusion</strong> </h2> <p>To sum up everything, VidBy is the best way to translate Marathi video to English and in the opposite direction.
