Most companies use video content to attract more and more people. It is an effective way to reach this goal, but it has drawbacks. It is a time-consuming and genuinely expensive thing to translate a video from one language into another, especially when it is all about the language pair of Polish and English. </p> <p>In this article, we are going to get to know you with the innovative video translation service VidBy which knows precisely how to translate Polish video to English and vice versa fast and at a low cost. However, the starting point is to learn more about the language pair. </p> <h2> <strong>The popularity and specification of the language pair (Polish-English)</strong> </h2> <p>You probably know that English is the world’s most spoken language. Approximately 400 million people belong to the group of native speakers of this language, and 1.2 billion can fluently speak and understand it. Considering such a wide spread of the language, it is worth highlighting that there are 160 existing dialects, which have their specific complexities for translators and artists who are involved in the video translation processes.</p> <p>The second language is Polish, a mother tongue for citizens of Poland. The total number of native speakers is around 45 million people, and 5 million people speak this language as the second one. The primary complexity of the language for translators and artists is grammar (three genders, seven cases, etc.).</p> <p>Considering the aspect of the language pair’s complexity, the translators and artists can take the offer and translate a video from Polish to English (or from English to Polish). Still, their services will cost you a lot of money and time. However, the Polish to English translation video service VidBy can handle this issue much easier and at a reasonable price.</p> <h2><strong>The algorithm of work: How to translate from Polish to English at VidBy?</strong></h2> <p>The video translation service VidBy makes it easy for the customer to understand the whole algorithm of its work (the aspect of video translation and dubbing Polish video to English or in the opposite direction). </p> <p>First of all, the customer should provide the service with the video content that is required to be translated. Secondly, it is necessary to specify the details of the order because the AI-based software, which makes all the work, should know in what way to dub and video translate Polish to English. And when the service completes the video translation, you can easily download the translated video on your device. </p> <p>Just go through these easy and straightforward steps and have no worries about the video translation because the service will do everything for you. Moreover, the additional features will guarantee the excellent quality of every translation.</p> <h2> <strong>The additional features to improve the translation from Polish to English</strong> </h2> <p>To improve the process and translate video Polish to English and vice versa, the innovative service VidBy has been developing a few additional features that are intended to reach this goal. </p> <h3><strong>A multitude of emotions</strong></h3> <p>The first feature to mention is the option to add different emotions to the translated videos. Without emotions, every translated video will not be realistic, and, consequently, the customer will not be satisfied with the final result. That is why the development team gives a shot to try out the application of the following emotions: </p> <ul> <li> Anger;</li> <li>Disgust;</li> <li>Joy;</li> <li>Surprise;</li> <li>Fear;</li> <li>Sadness.</li> </ul> <p>By the moment of writing this article, it was the completed list. However, the developers promise to extend it and add even more emotions. </p> <h3><strong>Speech synthesizer</strong></h3> <p>The second valuable feature of VidBy is the speech synthesizer. With its help, the AI-based software can generate not only the voices of males and females but also the voices of people by age. It means you can choose the voice of a child, teenager, an adult, or a senior. From one side, this feature seems not so extraordinary. However, after its implementation, you can witness fascinating results. </p> <h2> <strong>What are the benefits of working with VidBy?</strong> </h2> <p>Along with the features that the video translation service provides its customers with, there are several advantages of using VidBy. So, let us dive deeper and get to know all of them in detail. </p> <h3><strong>Quick translation result</strong></h3> <p>For many people, it is crucially important that the video translation can be done as soon as possible. And the delivery time is the first strength of the service. While other video translation services, which use real people for this job, spend days, weeks, or even months translating your video content from Polish to English (or from English to Polish), the AI-based software developed by VidBy does the same job 1,000 times quicker. Do not believe in it? Here is an example of estimating the delivery time - a one-minute video fragment is translated from Polish to English in two minutes. The math is a piece of cake - double the time of the total length of the original video. And that is all. </p> <h3> <strong>Guaranteed quality of translation</strong> </h3> <p>Wonder whether this AI-based software can provide you with the needed quality of video translation? Yes, it guarantees a video translation from Polish to English of fantastic quality. The additional features and the well-developed algorithm can easily reach the fantastic quality level.

As there is no need to hire professionals (video translators and artists), it is obvious that you can easily cut the expenses for the video translation from Polish to English and in the opposite direction.</p> <h3><strong>Different subscriptions</strong></h3> <p>One more thing that helps cut the expenses is the option to choose the subscription and use its advantages. The Polish to English translation video serviceVidBy provides its customers with three different subscriptions:</p> <ul> <li>Basis;</li> <li>Extended;</li> <li>Professional.</li> </ul> <p>Every subscription has its specifications and additional features (only the Basis subscription is the simplest and cheapest one).

And the subscribers of the professional subscription can use the option of editing transcripts. It is an extremely valuable feature because it allows customers to increase the accuracy rate of the translation, which, consequently, will lead to the proper understanding of the main idea/message of the video content.</p> <h2><strong>How to translate a video from Polish to English?</strong></h2> <p>And the last question remains - how to video translate Polish to English at VidBy?
